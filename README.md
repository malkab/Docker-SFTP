Docker Images for SFTP Servers
===
This Docker images are based on the work of __[Knut Ahlers](https://github.com/luzifer-docker/sftp-share)__ and __[Martin Honermeyer](https://github.com/djmaze)__. All credits to them. Just made some extra configurations and adaptations.

This service comes in two flavors:

- __SFTP-User_Pass__ configures a SFTP service with user / password log in;
- __SFTP-Keys__ configures a SFTP service with keys log in.

Please read their respective README for details.
